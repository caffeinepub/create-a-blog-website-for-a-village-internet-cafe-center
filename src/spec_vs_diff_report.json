  "summary": "Header and footer logo image paths were updated to the new v2 filename, but the diff does not show the new logo asset being added under frontend/public/assets/generated, and it’s not verifiable from the provided changes that *all* references to the old logo path across the frontend were updated. The footer also includes several content/attribution changes not requested by the BuildRequest.",

      "requirement": "A new logo image exists under frontend/public/assets/generated and differs from the previous design.",
      "reason": "The diff shows only TypeScript/TSX changes; no new/updated image asset under frontend/public/assets/generated is included, so the new logo file’s existence/design change cannot be confirmed.",

      "reason": "Only SiteHeader and SiteFooter were updated in the diff. The change does not provide evidence that there are no other references elsewhere (e.g., other components/pages) that still use the old path.",
